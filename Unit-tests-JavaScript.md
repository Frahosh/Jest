### Estimated time: 1h

## Why is testing important?
Testing can give you confidence that any changes or new features you introduce into your code will not break other parts of the application. It's particularly important when working on large applications in bigger teams and shipping new features to live systems. It also helps you debug the code you're developing and improve its quality.

## Unit testing
We will focus on unit testing; however, there are many types of tests we use in software development. Read [this short guide](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/types-of-software-testing) to learn more about them and their use cases.

There are quite a few good libraries that promise to make unit testing in JavaScript applications easier. The most popular ones are Mocha, Jasmine, Tape, and Jest. We will focus on [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as it became an industry standard in recent years.

- Read this guide to [getting started with Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started).
- Read this article about using [matchers](https://jestjs.io/docs/using-matchers), which will help you set the most common tests you might need for your applications.
